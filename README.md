## feature_selector_1


This is a POC for feature selector for XGB classifier models. It should be more computationally efficient than RFE FS.

Main algorithm is desribed in `prd.md` doc.
It will be tested on several datasets.
We can satrt from small and simple adatsets like `pydataset > rwm5yr`. For such a small dataset no subsampling is needed.
