## General instructions for coding agents

- Do not go outside this repo. Do not Delete or edit any files outside this workspace!
- Use rapid iteration. Start with a simple version of the agent that works, then add features incrementally. When dealing with large tasks, proceed in small increments and validate key assumptions/results for each increment before proceeding further.
- Do not run any code which is expected to take more than 10 minutes to run. Use timeouts. Use 3 minutes as default timeout for any code execution.
- Use agent_logs dir to store any logs related to agent runs. After completing each task/iteration, summarize the key steps taken by the agent and store them in a markdown file in the agent_logs dir. Specify which agent and model were used as well as exact timestamps.
