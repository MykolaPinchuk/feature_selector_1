# Global Instructions (Baseline)

- Do not go outside this repo. Do not delete or edit any files outside this workspace!
- Use rapid iteration. Start with a simple version that works, then add features incrementally. When dealing with large tasks, proceed in small increments and validate key assumptions/results for each increment before proceeding further. Validate assumptions quickly. Then add complexity incrementally.
- Do not run any code which is expected to take more than 10 minutes to run. Use timeouts. Use 3 minutes as default timeout for any code execution.
- Run code to verify behavior. Do not rely on assumptions or placeholders.
- When in doubt, err on the side of not overengineering.
- Never replace user-provided values with placeholders.
- When code fails repeatedly, capture detailed step-by-step logs and investigate.
- Do not touch git except for .gitignore. Human will handle git workflow. Make sure that large files are added to .gitignore.
- You can use all except one vCPUs/threads available at this machine.
- Use logs/agents/ dir to store any logs related to agent runs. After completing each task/iteration, summarize the key steps taken by the agent and store them in a markdown file in the agent_logs dir. Specify which agent and model were used as well as exact timestamps.

# DS Dev Profile

- If you need to build ML models, prefer XGBoost to RF. RF is much slower while its performance is slightly worse than that of XGBoost. In general, prefer 1. XGBoost and 2. LightGBM over any other type of model.
- Always do at least basic EDA and save its results.
- When doing modeling, think about what target variable is and what features are. Think about what they actually mean. Do not just blindly apply models without understanding the data.
- When doing modeling, always split data into at least three sets (train, validation, test). Always report results on all three sets.
- Iterate rapidly. Start with small subsamples. When scaling up to full data, estimate how long code will take to run. Avoid any code that is expected to take more than 5 minutes to run.
- Use multiprocessing to speed up code if needed.
